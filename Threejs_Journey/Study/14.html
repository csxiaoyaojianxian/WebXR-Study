        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>At this point in your journey, you might want to share what you've built. A screenshot or a video is a good start, but your friends and family will enjoy an interactive version much more. It's time to make those WebGL experiences live.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Years ago, we didn't have that many solutions to make a website live. Today, it's a bit more complicated, but we also have access to many handy solutions.</p>
<h2>Traditional build</h2>
<p>In the next section, we are going to use a solution that doesn't require you to subscribe to a "traditional" hosting solution like OVH, 1and1 or Gandhi where you have to upload files manually by using an FTP client. Some of you, however, might already have a host like one of these and you just want to get those files that you are supposed to upload.</p>
<p>You can't simply put the whole project with the node_modules folder and the webpack configuration on the host. First, you need to "build" your project within that webpack configuration in order to create HTML, CSS, JS and assets files that can be interpreted by browsers.</p>
<p>To build your project, run <code spellcheck="false">npm run build</code> in the terminal.</p>
<p>This command will run the script located in the <code spellcheck="false">/package.json</code> file in the <code spellcheck="false">scripts &gt; build</code> property.</p>
<p>Wait a few seconds and the files should be available in the <code spellcheck="false">/dist/</code> folder which will be created when <code spellcheck="false">build</code> is executed. You can then put those files online using your favorite FTP client.</p>
<p>Whenever you want to upload a new version, run <code spellcheck="false">npm run build</code> again even if the <code spellcheck="false">/dist/</code> folder already exists.</p>
<p>We are not going to cover the setup of one of those "traditional" hosting solutions because we are going to use a more appropriate solution in the next section.</p>
<h2>Vercel</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is one of those "modern" hosting solutions and features continuous integration (automatisation of testing, deployment and others development steps like this). It is very developer friendly and easy to setup.</p>
<p>You can use it for complex projects, but also for very simple "single page" websites like the ones we create within this course.</p>
<p>Before continuing, be aware that there is no partnership between me (Bruno Simon) and Vercel. I just like to use it for my small creative experiences.</p>
<p>Also, there are other good alternatives that we should mention like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware also that you might see slight differences between the rest of this lesson and your own experience with Vercel. It's quite a new solution and the developers keep improving the service.</p>
<h3>Create an account</h3>
<p>First, go to <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">vercel.com</a> and create an account.</p>
<p>You can choose between different login methods such as <strong>GitHub</strong> connect, <strong>GitLab</strong> connect, <strong>Bitbucket</strong> connect or classic <strong>Email</strong> access.</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-01.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-01.png" width="724" height="555" alt="step-01.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>The "connect" choices might be good options because one of the great features of Vercel is that it allows continuous integration as a versioning solution. If you don't know what <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> are, they are hosting solutions for your Git repositories. In other words, it's where most developers save their code.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with them, you can totally go for it. This will simplify the process and Vercel will automatically fetch your repository, help you setup the live version and automatically update it when you push new versions on the repository. You can even choose a specific branch.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with Git hosting solutions, don't worry, we are going to keep this lesson accessible to most students and choose the <strong>Email</strong> solution. Even if you are currently using Git, this solution will still work fine. Click the E<strong>mail</strong> link:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-02.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-02.png" width="466" height="97" alt="step-02.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Then enter your email address and follow the steps to create your account:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-03.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-03.png" width="436" height="150" alt="step-03.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Vercel will send you an email confirmation with a link so that you can log in. Once you've clicked on that link, you should be connected.</p>
<h3>Add Vercel to your project</h3>
<p>Vercel is available as an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vercel">NPM module</a> that you can install globally on your computer or as a dependency on your project. We are going to add it to the project so that, if we want to setup the project on another computer or we want to share it with another developer, we  don't have to install anything on that computer.</p>
<p>In the terminal of your project, run <code spellcheck="false">npm install vercel</code>.  After a short while, the installation will be complete, but you will probably notice that there are some vulnerabilities. The terminal will instruct you to run an audit to fix them. You can usually ignore these warnings since they are probably false positives.</p>
<p>Although we added Vercel as a project dependency, instead of globally, it's still not available in the terminal. Your NPM scripts will have access to it, but you will first need to make the following change.</p>
<p>In <code spellcheck="false">package.json</code>, in the <code spellcheck="false">"scripts"</code> property, add a new script named <code spellcheck="false">"deploy"</code> and write <code spellcheck="false">"vercel --prod"</code> as the value (don't forget the <code spellcheck="false">,</code> after the <code spellcheck="false">"dev"</code> script):</p>
<div class="code-toolbar"><pre contenteditable="" class=" language-javascript"><code spellcheck="false" class=" language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
<span class="token string">"scripts"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
<span class="token comment">// ...</span>
<span class="token string">"deploy"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"vercel --prod"</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre><div class="toolbar"><div class="toolbar-item"><span>JavaScript</span></div><div class="toolbar-item"><button>Copy</button></div></div></div>
<p>If you use the <code spellcheck="false">"vercel"</code> command without <code spellcheck="false">â€”-prod</code>, the code will be published on a preview URL so that you can test it before going to production. Though it is an interesting feature, we don't need a preview version.</p>
<p>From now on, if you want to deploy your project online, you can simply run <code spellcheck="false">npm run deploy</code> in the terminal.</p>
<h3>Deploy for the first time</h3>
<p>The first time you want to deploy your project, Vercel will ask you for some information in order to connect to your account and setup the project.</p>
<p>In the terminal, run <code spellcheck="false">npm run deploy</code></p>
<p>If earlier, you chose to connect with an email, use the <strong>up</strong> and <strong>down</strong> arrows to select <code spellcheck="false">Continue with Email</code> and press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-04.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-04.png" width="542" height="308" alt="step-04.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Then write your email:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-05.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-05.png" width="600" height="118" alt="step-05.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Vercel will send you an email like earlier. Click on the link available in that email and the terminal should automatically continue to the next step:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-06.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-06.png" width="951" height="64" alt="step-06.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>At this point, you should be prompt with a confirmation to setup and deploy the current folder. Choose <code spellcheck="false">Y</code> and press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-07.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-07.png" width="700" height="28" alt="step-07.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>You can have multiple scopes and teams associated with your account. If you've just created your account, there should be only one. Choose it by pressing <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-07%201.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-07%201.png" width="409" height="45" alt="step-07.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>In our case, we are creating a new project and we don't want to associate our code with an existing project. Write <code spellcheck="false">n</code> and press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-08.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-08.png" width="390" height="23" alt="step-08.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Vercel will try to guess the project name, but you can change it to anything you want. You can use lower case, numbers and dashes. Press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-09.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-09.png" width="578" height="21" alt="step-09.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>If you are executing that code at the root of the project folder, you can keep <code spellcheck="false">./</code> and press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-10.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-10.png" width="471" height="21" alt="step-10.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Vercel has default settings for things like the build command or the bundle destination folder. We need to override those. Write <code spellcheck="false">y</code> and press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-11.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-11.png" width="615" height="107" alt="step-11.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Vercel's default <code spellcheck="false">Build Command</code> is <code spellcheck="false">npm run build</code> and it's the same for us. But Vercel's default <code spellcheck="false">Output Directory</code> is <code spellcheck="false">public</code> while ours is <code spellcheck="false">dist</code>.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>up</strong> and <strong>down</strong> arrows to move the cursor on <code spellcheck="false">Output Directory</code> and press <code spellcheck="false">Space</code> to check it. Then, press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code> to go to the next step:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-12.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-12.png" width="652" height="85" alt="step-12.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Write <code spellcheck="false">dist</code> and press <code spellcheck="false">Enter</code>:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-13.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-13.png" width="385" height="27" alt="step-13.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>That's it, your website should start deploying on Vercel.</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-14.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-14.png" width="937" height="84" alt="step-14.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Wait a minute or two and Vercel should prompt you with the URL to the live version.</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-15.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-15.png" width="878" height="19" alt="step-15.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Vercel should automatically copy that URL to your clipboard. You can paste it into your favorite browser and test the live version.</p>
<h2>Further settings</h2>
<p>Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">vercel.com</a> and make sure you are logged in.</p>
<p>You should have access to your <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/dashboard">dashboard</a> and see your project:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-16.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-16.png" width="556" height="421" alt="step-16.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Click on your project. This is the screen you should see next:</p>
<p class="is-image"><span class="image-inner"><img data-src="./assets/lessons/14/step-17.png" src="./assets/lessons/14/step-17.png" width="1053" height="834" alt="step-17.png" class="is-loaded"></span></p>
<p>Here, you can see a preview of your project, get information about the latest builds, change deployment preferences, see potential errors, etc.</p>
<p>You can even add a custom domain, but we won't cover that in this lesson.</p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>But wait, is everything free?</p>
<p>Yes and no. If you just want to share those cool WebGL experiences you're building with the world with no commercial intent, the free plan (named <strong>Hobby</strong>) should be more than enough. You can create as many projects as you want with all the features we just saw.</p>
<p>But if you have commercial intents, or want to use specific features like teams, password protections for the preview, firewalls, etc., you might need to use a paid plan.</p>
<p>Also, the <strong>Hobby</strong> plan has <strong>bandwidth</strong> and <strong>build time</strong> limitations. This means that if your website gets a lot of attention or you deploy too many times, you'll have to switch to a paid plan.</p>
<p>Plans and pricing can be find here: <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/pricing">vercel.com/pricing</a></p>
<h2>Share!</h2>
<p>No excuse now. Share your work with the world and don't forget to use the <code spellcheck="false">#threejsJourney</code> hashtag on Twitter.</p>
